Absolutely — and this is an important addition. Below I’ve layered security posture in explicitly, but in a way that sounds confident and deliberate, not alarmist or technical. It reinforces that security improves because of the strategy, not despite it.
I’ve added a dedicated section plus security framing woven throughout, so the CISO can point to it clearly.

Identity Strategy — Business Narrative (Security-Enhanced)
Why this matters now
At Macquarie, identity controls exist across the organisation, but they are complex, fragmented, and operationally heavy.
This creates risk in subtle but real ways:
	• Controls depend on manual steps
	• Access and authentication decisions are delayed or incomplete
	• Failures are detected late
	• Privileged access relies heavily on long-lived credentials
This strategy addresses these risks by design, while improving speed and reducing cost.

What we are changing
We are shifting identity from a control-by-process model to a control-by-design model.
Instead of relying on:
	• Human intervention
	• Periodic reviews
	• Static credentials
	• After-the-fact detection
We are building:
	• Real-time visibility
	• Automated enforcement
	• Short-lived trust
	• Continuous validation
This strengthens security while reducing operational effort.

How the strategy improves security posture
1. Controls move from periodic to continuous
What changes
	• Identity events are captured as they happen
	• Access, authentication, and privilege changes are observable in real time
	• Failures and anomalies are detected immediately
Security impact
	• Reduced window of exposure
	• Faster detection of misuse or misconfiguration
	• Better alignment with how applications and workloads actually operate

2. Privileged access shifts away from shared secrets
What changes
	• Fewer long-lived credentials
	• Reduced reliance on shared or generic accounts
	• Increased use of workload identity and attestation
Security impact
	• Lower risk of credential leakage
	• Reduced blast radius if a system is compromised
	• Stronger control over who or what can act with privilege
This materially improves Macquarie’s privilege risk profile.

3. Onboarding enforces security from day one
What changes
	• Applications are onboarded with access, authentication, and governance together
	• Security controls are not bolted on later
	• Identity standards are applied consistently
Security impact
	• Fewer gaps during early application lifecycle
	• Reduced risk of unmanaged access
	• Stronger baseline controls across the estate

4. Fewer manual controls means fewer human errors
What changes
	• Automation replaces repetitive manual steps
	• Identity decisions are made using structured data
	• Workflows are consistent and repeatable
Security impact
	• Reduced misconfigurations
	• Fewer missed revocations
	• Lower dependency on individual knowledge

5. Observability and SRE reduce operational risk
What changes
	• Identity platforms are monitored like critical services
	• Failures are visible and actionable
	• Recovery is faster and more predictable
Security impact
	• Reduced likelihood of prolonged control failures
	• Faster containment of issues
	• Increased confidence in automated enforcement

Security posture outcomes
By executing this strategy, Macquarie achieves:
	• Stronger preventive controls
	• Faster detection and response
	• Reduced privilege risk
	• Lower likelihood of audit findings
	• Improved resilience of identity services
Importantly, these improvements are structural, not dependent on increased process or headcount.

How this also reduces cost
Security improves because we remove complexity:
	• Fewer bespoke controls to manage
	• Less remediation work after failures
	• Lower audit and compliance effort
	• Reduced operational overhead in PAM and access management
Security and efficiency improve together.

Executive summary for CISO
	“This strategy strengthens Macquarie’s security posture by making identity controls continuous, automated, and observable — reducing privilege risk and operational exposure while lowering cost.”

One-line close for business leaders
	“We are reducing risk by simplifying identity — not by adding more process.”

If you want next, I can:
	• Translate this into Board-level risk language
	• Map improvements directly to audit themes
	• Produce a security posture before/after slide
	• Write a CISO-to-Business Head briefing note
You’re in a very strong position with this narrative.


Perfect additions. I’ve woven both points in cleanly and business-first, without dragging the reader into technical depth. This version keeps the story intact, strengthens the security posture narrative, and makes it very clear you are modernising PAM and onboarding, not just tweaking tools.
Below is the revised business-facing narrative, with only the new concepts added and integrated naturally.

Identity Strategy — Business Narrative (Updated)
Why this matters now
At Macquarie, identity controls exist across the organisation, but they are hard to use, slow to change, and expensive to operate.
Business teams experience this as:
	• Long onboarding cycles
	• Repeated handoffs across teams
	• Manual reviews that don’t reflect reality
	• Limited visibility into who has access and why
	• Delays when authentication or access changes are required
This identity strategy is about fixing that experience, while strengthening control and reducing cost.

What we are changing
We are shifting identity from a tool-centric, ticket-driven model to a platform-based capability that manages:
	• Who can access systems
	• How systems authenticate
	• How workloads trust each other
	• How access is monitored and revoked
Instead of identity being:
	• Batch-based
	• Secrets-heavy
	• Manually operated
We are making identity:
	• Event-driven
	• Workload-aware
	• API-enabled
	• Observable and resilient

How we are actioning the strategy
1. Making identity data available in real time
What we are doing
	• Creating a real-time Identity Data Platform
	• Publishing identity lifecycle events, access changes, authentication outcomes, and privilege usage
	• Providing analytics and APIs for consumers
What this means for the business
	• No more spreadsheets or ad-hoc reporting
	• Real-time visibility into access, authentication, and privilege state
	• Faster investigation and decision-making
	• Identity data becomes actionable, not static

2. Simplifying onboarding — beyond access alone
What we are doing
	• Redesigning onboarding as an end-to-end identity process
	• Automating not just access provisioning, but:
		○ Authentication onboarding
		○ Role and entitlement setup
		○ Privileged access tagging
		○ Governance readiness
	• Using reusable workflows rather than bespoke steps per application
What this means for the business
	• Onboarding is faster and more predictable
	• Applications are ready for authentication, access, and governance from day one
	• Fewer manual steps and fewer handoffs
	• Less rework later when controls need to be enforced
Onboarding becomes a single, consistent process, not a series of disconnected tasks.

3. Moving PAM away from secrets to workload identity
What we are doing
	• Reducing reliance on long-lived secrets and shared credentials
	• Introducing machine and workload identity attestation
	• Allowing systems to authenticate based on who they are, not what secret they hold
	• Aligning PAM with modern workload communication patterns
What this means for the business
	• Fewer secrets to manage, rotate, and audit
	• Reduced operational risk from leaked or stale credentials
	• Faster onboarding of system-to-system integrations
	• Stronger control over privileged access without slowing delivery
PAM shifts from manual secret handling to automated trust between workloads.

4. Enabling self-service through one identity platform
What we are doing
	• Creating a single identity interaction layer
	• Power that layer using consistent APIs
	• Support multiple channels from the same foundation:
		○ UI
		○ System integrations
		○ Automation pipelines
What this means for the business
	• One way to interact with identity
	• Consistent behaviour across all channels
	• Less dependency on tickets and central teams
	• Identity becomes easier to adopt and easier to scale

5. Improving resilience and reliability
What we are doing
	• Introducing monitoring and observability across identity workflows
	• Tracking failures in access, authentication, and privilege processes
	• Applying SRE practices to identity platforms
What this means for the business
	• Fewer disruptions caused by identity failures
	• Faster recovery when issues occur
	• Confidence to automate more without increasing risk
	• Identity becomes predictable and dependable

How this reduces cost for the business
This strategy reduces cost by:
	• Removing 70–80% of manual access and privilege work
	• Reducing effort spent managing secrets and shared credentials
	• Eliminating duplicate onboarding and review processes
	• Lowering the cost of audits and remediation
	• Reducing reliance on specialist tooling and skills
The result is lower cost per application, lower cost per access change, and lower cost to operate identity controls.

How this improves quality
	• Access and authentication decisions are based on real-time data
	• Privileged access is short-lived and workload-bound
	• Reviews are accurate, targeted, and meaningful
	• Orphaned access and stale secrets are reduced
This leads to stronger controls, better audit outcomes, and lower operational risk.

How this accelerates delivery
	• Applications onboard faster and more consistently
	• Authentication and access are ready together
	• System integrations no longer depend on shared secrets
	• Identity becomes part of delivery pipelines, not a bottleneck
The business can move faster without weakening controls.

The outcome
By executing this identity strategy, we:
	• Reduce cost
	• Improve control quality
	• Increase delivery speed
	• Strengthen security posture
	• Create a better experience for business teams
Most importantly, identity becomes an enabler of business outcomes, not a constraint.

Executive one-liner
	“This strategy modernises identity across access, authentication, and privilege, reducing cost while making secure delivery faster and more reliable.”

If you want next, I can:
	• Turn this into a 2-page CISO briefing
	• Create a before vs after visual for PAM and onboarding
	• Produce speaker notes for a 20-minute exec presentation
	• Map each point to FY27–FY28 measurable outcomes
Just tell me where you want to land.


Below is a business-facing narrative, written deliberately in plain language, focused on outcomes, actions, and confidence, not identity jargon.
This is the version a CISO can confidently use with a Business Head to explain what is changing, what we are doing differently, and how it helps them.

Identity Strategy — Business Narrative
Why this matters now
At Macquarie, identity controls exist across the organisation, but they are hard to use, slow to change, and expensive to operate.
Business teams experience this as:
	• Long onboarding cycles
	• Repeated handoffs across teams
	• Manual reviews that don’t reflect reality
	• Limited visibility into who has access and why
	• Delays when changes are required
This identity strategy is about fixing that experience, while strengthening control and reducing cost.

What we are changing
We are shifting identity from a back-office function to a business-enabled platform.
Instead of identity being:
	• Ticket-driven
	• Batch-based
	• Tool-centric
We are making identity:
	• Data-driven
	• Event-based

	• Observable and resilient
This allows identity to support the business at speed, without increasing risk.

How we are actioning the strategy
1. Making identity data available in real time
What we are doing
	• Creating a real-time Identity Data Platform
	• Publishing identity events, access changes, and lifecycle outcomes as data
	• Providing analytics and APIs for consumers
What this means for the business
	• No more spreadsheets for entitlement data
	• No waiting for reports or dashboards to be built
	• Teams can see access posture, changes, and risks when they need it
	• Identity data becomes usable, not locked inside systems

2. Simplifying onboarding and access changes
What we are doing
	• Building reusable onboarding and lifecycle workflows
	• Standardising approvals, notifications, and validations
	• Removing manual handoffs between teams
What this means for the business
	• Applications onboard faster and more predictably
	• Access changes are automated end-to-end
	• Less back-and-forth with central teams
	• Fewer delays caused by missing or incomplete information

3. Enabling self-service through one identity platform
What we are doing
	• Creating one identity entry point for business and technology teams

	• Applying SRE practices to identity services
What this means for the business
	• Fewer disruptions caused by identity failures
	• Faster resolution when issues occur
	• Confidence to automate more without increasing risk
	• Identity becomes predictable, not fragile

How this reduces cost for the business
This strategy directly reduces cost by:
	• Removing manual processing (70–80% reduction in manual access work)
	• Reducing rework caused by poor data quality
	• Eliminating duplicate integrations and bespoke solutions
	• Lowering operational effort to support audits and reviews
	• Reducing dependency on specialised skills and fragile customisations
The result is lower cost per application, lower cost per access decision, and lower cost to operate identity controls.

How this improves quality
	• Access decisions are based on real-time data
	• Reviews are accurate, targeted, and meaningful
	• Orphaned and inactive access is reduced
	• Controls reflect how applications actually behave
This leads to better security outcomes and stronger audit confidence, without increasing overhead.

How this accelerates delivery
	• Applications onboard faster
	• Identity changes propagate immediately
	• Business teams are less dependent on central queues
	• Identity becomes part of delivery pipelines, not a blocker
This allows the business to move faster without weakening controls.

The outcome
By executing this identity strategy, we are:
	• Reducing cost
	• Improving control quality
	• Increasing delivery speed
	• Creating a better experience for business teams
Most importantly, we are making identity work for the business, not the other way around.

One-sentence summary for executives
	“This strategy turns identity into a reliable, self-service platform that reduces cost, strengthens control, and enables the business to move faster with confidence.”
