⸻ Identity Strategy — Business Narrative Why this matters now At Macquarie, identity controls exist across the organisation, but they are hard to use, slow to change, and expensive to operate. Business teams experience this as: • Long onboarding cycles • Repeated handoffs across teams • Manual reviews that don’t reflect reality • Limited visibility into who has access and why • Delays when changes are required This identity strategy is about fixing that experience, while strengthening control and reducing cost. ⸻ What we are changing We are shifting identity from a back-office function to a business-enabled platform. Instead of identity being: • Ticket-driven • Batch-based • Tool-centric We are making identity: • Data-driven • Event-based • API-enabled • Observable and resilient This allows identity to support the business at speed, without increasing risk. ⸻ How we are actioning the strategy 1. Making identity data available in real time What we are doing • Creating a real-time Identity Data Platform • Publishing identity events, access changes, and lifecycle outcomes as data • Providing analytics and APIs for consumers What this means for the business • No more spreadsheets for entitlement data • No waiting for reports or dashboards to be built • Teams can see access posture, changes, and risks when they need it • Identity data becomes usable, not locked inside systems ⸻ 2. Simplifying onboarding and access changes What we are doing • Building reusable onboarding and lifecycle workflows • Standardising approvals, notifications, and validations • Removing manual handoffs between teams What this means for the business • Applications onboard faster and more predictably • Access changes are automated end-to-end • Less back-and-forth with central teams • Fewer delays caused by missing or incomplete information ⸻ 3. Enabling self-service through one identity platform What we are doing • Creating one identity entry point for business and technology teams • Power that experience using a consistent API layer • Support multiple channels from the same foundation (UI, system integrations, automation) What this means for the business • One place to interact with identity • Consistent experience across tools and teams • Reduced reliance on tickets and manual requests • Identity becomes easier to consume and easier to trust ⸻ 4. Improving resilience and reliability What we are doing • Introducing monitoring and observability across identity workflows • Detecting failures early and recovering automatically • Applying SRE practices to identity services What this means for the business • Fewer disruptions caused by identity failures • Faster resolution when issues occur • Confidence to automate more without increasing risk • Identity becomes predictable, not fragile ⸻ How this reduces cost for the business This strategy directly reduces cost by: • Removing manual processing (70–80% reduction in manual access work) • Reducing rework caused by poor data quality • Eliminating duplicate integrations and bespoke solutions • Lowering operational effort to support audits and reviews • Reducing dependency on specialised skills and fragile customisations The result is lower cost per application, lower cost per access decision, and lower cost to operate identity controls. ⸻ How this improves quality • Access decisions are based on real-time data • Reviews are accurate, targeted, and meaningful • Orphaned and inactive access is reduced • Controls reflect how applications actually behave This leads to better security outcomes and stronger audit confidence, without increasing overhead. ⸻ How this accelerates delivery • Applications onboard faster • Identity changes propagate immediately • Business teams are less dependent on central queues • Identity becomes part of delivery pipelines, not a blocker This allows the business to move faster without weakening controls. ⸻ The outcome By executing this identity strategy, we are: • Reducing cost • Improving control quality • Increasing delivery speed • Creating a better experience for business teams Most importantly, we are making identity work for the business, not the other way around. ⸻ One-sentence summary for executives “This strategy turns identity into a reliable, self-service platform that reduces cost, strengthens control, and enables the business to move faster with confidence.” ⸻ If you want, I can next: • Condense this into a 1-page executive brief • Turn it into CISO talking notes • Map each action to specific FY27–FY28 deliverables • Or rewrite it for a Board-level audience Absolutely — and this is an important addition. Below I’ve layered security posture in explicitly, but in a way that sounds confident and deliberate, not alarmist or technical. It reinforces that security improves because of the strategy, not despite it. I’ve added a dedicated section plus security framing woven throughout, so the CISO can point to it clearly. ⸻ Identity Strategy — Business Narrative (Security-Enhanced) Why this matters now At Macquarie, identity controls exist across the organisation, but they are complex, fragmented, and operationally heavy. This creates risk in subtle but real ways: • Controls depend on manual steps • Access and authentication decisions are delayed or incomplete • Failures are detected late • Privileged access relies heavily on long-lived credentials This strategy addresses these risks by design, while improving speed and reducing cost. ⸻ What we are changing We are shifting identity from a control-by-process model to a control-by-design model. Instead of relying on: • Human intervention • Periodic reviews • Static credentials • After-the-fact detection We are building: • Real-time visibility • Automated enforcement • Short-lived trust • Continuous validation This strengthens security while reducing operational effort. ⸻ How the strategy improves security posture 1. Controls move from periodic to continuous What changes • Identity events are captured as they happen • Access, authentication, and privilege changes are observable in real time • Failures and anomalies are detected immediately Security impact • Reduced window of exposure • Faster detection of misuse or misconfiguration • Better alignment with how applications and workloads actually operate ⸻ 2. Privileged access shifts away from shared secrets What changes • Fewer long-lived credentials • Reduced reliance on shared or generic accounts • Increased use of workload identity and attestation Security impact • Lower risk of credential leakage • Reduced blast radius if a system is compromised • Stronger control over who or what can act with privilege This materially improves Macquarie’s privilege risk profile. ⸻ 3. Onboarding enforces security from day one What changes • Applications are onboarded with access, authentication, and governance together • Security controls are not bolted on later • Identity standards are applied consistently Security impact • Fewer gaps during early application lifecycle • Reduced risk of unmanaged access • Stronger baseline controls across the estate ⸻ 4. Fewer manual controls means fewer human errors What changes • Automation replaces repetitive manual steps • Identity decisions are made using structured data • Workflows are consistent and repeatable Security impact • Reduced misconfigurations • Fewer missed revocations • Lower dependency on individual knowledge ⸻ 5. Observability and SRE reduce operational risk What changes • Identity platforms are monitored like critical services • Failures are visible and actionable • Recovery is faster and more predictable Security impact • Reduced likelihood of prolonged control failures • Faster containment of issues • Increased confidence in automated enforcement ⸻ Security posture outcomes By executing this strategy, Macquarie achieves: • Stronger preventive controls • Faster detection and response • Reduced privilege risk • Lower likelihood of audit findings • Improved resilience of identity services Importantly, these improvements are structural, not dependent on increased process or headcount. ⸻ How this also reduces cost Security improves because we remove complexity: • Fewer bespoke controls to manage • Less remediation work after failures • Lower audit and compliance effort • Reduced operational overhead in PAM and access management Security and efficiency improve together. ⸻ Executive summary for CISO “This strategy strengthens Macquarie’s security posture by making identity controls continuous, automated, and observable — reducing privilege risk and operational exposure while lowering cost.” ⸻ One-line close for business leaders “We are reducing risk by simplifying identity — not by adding more process.” ⸻ If you want next, I can: • Translate this into Board-level risk language • Map improvements directly to audit themes • Produce a security posture before/after slide • Write a CISO-to-Business Head briefing note You’re in a very strong position with this narrative. Perfect — below is a single, cohesive, business-facing document that combines the last three answers into one clear narrative. It is written so a CISO can forward it directly to a Business Head, or use it as a talking document without slides. You can treat this as a 1–2 page Identity Strategy narrative. ⸻ Identity Strategy Reducing Cost, Improving Security, and Enabling Seamless Experience ⸻ Executive summary Macquarie’s identity capabilities are critical to how applications are onboarded, accessed, secured, and governed. Today, those capabilities exist — but they are fragmented, manually operated, and difficult to scale. This Identity Strategy defines how we simplify identity engineering to: • Reduce operational cost • Improve security posture • Deliver a seamless, faster experience for business teams The strategy does this by shifting identity from a process-heavy, manual control model to a data-driven, automated, and observable platform that enables the business to move faster with confidence. ⸻ Why change is needed now Across the organisation, identity controls are in place, but they rely heavily on: • Manual work orders • Batch-driven processes • Multiple disconnected tools and interfaces • Long-lived credentials and static secrets • Periodic reviews instead of continuous validation This creates real challenges: • Slow onboarding of applications and changes • High operational cost for central teams • Limited visibility for business owners • Increased risk when access changes are missed, delayed, or fail silently The current model does not scale with the pace at which Macquarie is building and operating applications. ⸻ What this strategy changes This strategy repositions identity as a foundational platform capability that enables the business, rather than a set of tools that teams work around. It focuses on four outcomes: 1. Simpler onboarding and lifecycle management 2. Reduced manual effort and cost 3. Stronger, built-in security controls 4. Better visibility and resilience ⸻ How the strategy improves security posture Security is strengthened by design, not by adding more process. Continuous instead of periodic controls • Identity events are captured as they occur • Access, authentication, and privilege changes are visible in real time • Failures are detected early, not during reviews months later Result: Reduced exposure windows and faster response. ⸻ Privileged access moves away from static secrets • Reduced reliance on long-lived credentials • Fewer shared and generic accounts • Shift toward workload identity and attestation for machine-to-machine access Result: Lower credential leakage risk and smaller blast radius. ⸻ Secure-by-default onboarding Onboarding is no longer just about granting access. Applications are onboarded with: • Authentication • Access management • Governance • Privilege controls all applied together from the start. Result: Fewer gaps, fewer retrofitted controls, and more consistent security. ⸻ Fewer manual steps, fewer errors Automation replaces repetitive, manual identity work: • Access changes • Reviews • Lifecycle transitions • Privilege handling Result: Reduced misconfiguration risk and fewer missed revocations. ⸻ Resilience and observability through SRE Identity services are treated as critical platforms: • Health and failures are monitored • Recovery is faster and predictable • Issues are visible before they become incidents Result: Reduced operational risk and higher confidence in controls. ⸻ How this reduces cost for the business Cost reduction comes from simplification, not reduced coverage. Fewer manual work orders • Today: thousands of access and review tickets per month • Target: automation handles the majority of common cases Impact: Lower operational cost and faster turnaround. ⸻ Less rework and remediation • Fewer failed automations • Fewer escalations due to poor data quality • Reduced audit remediation effort Impact: Less hidden cost across business and technology teams. ⸻ Consolidated tooling and capability overlap • Rationalising overlapping identity and PAM capabilities • Moving to SaaS where appropriate • Building missing capabilities once and reusing them Impact: Lower licensing, lower support effort, simpler operating model. ⸻ How this enables a seamless business experience One self-service identity experience • A single portal for identity interactions • Consistent experience across access, privilege, and lifecycle actions Outcome: Less confusion, fewer handoffs, faster outcomes. ⸻ Multi-channel identity access One consistent set of identity APIs powers: • User interfaces • System integrations • Automation pipelines • Developer workflows Outcome: Faster integration and less duplication. ⸻ Business autonomy over identity data • Real-time identity data available via events and APIs • Business teams can consume and act on their data directly Outcome: Reduced dependency on central teams and faster decision-making. ⸻ What success looks like By executing this strategy, Macquarie achieves: • 70–80% reduction in manual identity work • Faster onboarding of applications and changes • Stronger and more consistent security controls • Improved audit outcomes • Lower total cost of ownership for identity platforms Most importantly: Identity becomes an enabler of business velocity, not a bottleneck. ⸻ Closing statement This strategy does not reduce security to move faster. It improves security by simplifying identity. By building identity as a resilient, observable, and automated platform, Macquarie reduces cost, strengthens controls, and delivers a better experience for both business and technology teams. ⸻ If you want next, I can: • Compress this into a 1-page executive brief • Turn it into a CISO speaking script • Create a before vs after cost/security view • Map outcomes directly to audit and risk themes You’re very well positioned with this narrative. ——
