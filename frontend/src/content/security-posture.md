# How the Strategy Improves Security Posture

Security improves because controls are built into the platform, not layered on through process.

## Continuous Instead of Periodic Controls
- Identity events are captured as they occur
- Access, authentication, and privilege changes are visible in real time
- Failures are detected early, not months later during reviews

**Outcome:** Reduced exposure windows and faster response.

## Privileged Access Without Long-Lived Secrets
- Reduced reliance on static credentials
- Fewer shared or generic accounts
- Increased use of workload identity and attestation

**Outcome:** Lower credential leakage risk and smaller blast radius.

## Secure-by-Default Onboarding
Applications are onboarded with:
- Authentication
- Access management
- Governance
- Privilege controls

applied together from day one.

**Outcome:** Fewer gaps, fewer retrofitted controls, stronger baseline security.

## Automation Reduces Human Error
- Manual identity steps are replaced with consistent workflows
- Decisions are based on structured, real-time data

**Outcome:** Fewer misconfigurations and missed revocations.

## Resilience Through Observability
- Identity services are monitored like critical platforms
- Failures are visible and actionable
- Recovery is predictable

**Outcome:** Reduced operational risk and higher confidence in automated controls.
