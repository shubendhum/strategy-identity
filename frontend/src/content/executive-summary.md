# Executive Summary

This strategy turns identity into a reliable, self-service platform that:
- Reduces cost
- Strengthens security
- Improves delivery speed
- Creates a better experience for business teams

Security improves by simplifying identity, not by adding more process.

Identity works for the business, not the other way around.
