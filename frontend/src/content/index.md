# Identity Strategy

## Reducing Cost, Improving Security, and Enabling Seamless Experience

Identity is fundamental to how applications are onboarded, accessed, secured, and governed.

Today, identity capabilities exist across the organisation, but they are fragmented, manually operated, and difficult to scale. This strategy defines how we simplify identity so it works **for the business**, not against it.

By shifting identity from a process-heavy control function to a data-driven platform, we reduce cost, strengthen security, and enable the business to move faster with confidence.
