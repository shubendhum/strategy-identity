# What Is Changing

We are repositioning identity from a back-office function to a business-enabled platform.

### From
- Ticket-driven
- Manual and batch-based
- Tool-centric
- Reactive and review-based

### To
- Data-driven
- Event-based
- API-enabled
- Observable and resilient

This allows identity to support delivery at speed, without increasing risk or operational overhead.
