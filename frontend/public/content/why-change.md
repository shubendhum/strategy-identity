# Why Change Is Needed Now

Across the organisation, identity controls rely heavily on:
- Manual work orders and tickets
- Batch-based processing
- Disconnected tools and interfaces
- Long-lived credentials and static secrets
- Periodic reviews instead of continuous validation

This creates real business impact:
- Slow onboarding of applications and access changes
- High operational cost for central teams
- Limited visibility for business owners
- Increased risk when access changes are delayed or missed

The current model does not scale with the pace at which the organisation is building and operating applications.
