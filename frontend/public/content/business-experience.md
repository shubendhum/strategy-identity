# How This Improves the Business Experience

## One Identity Entry Point
- A single place to interact with identity
- Consistent experience across access, privilege, and lifecycle actions

**Outcome:** Less confusion, fewer handoffs, faster outcomes.

## Multi-Channel Access
A consistent API layer supports:
- User interfaces
- System integrations
- Automation pipelines
- Developer workflows

**Outcome:** Faster integration and less duplication.

## Real-Time Identity Data
- Identity data is available through APIs and events
- Business teams can see access posture and changes when they need it

**Outcome:** Reduced dependency on central teams and faster decision-making.
