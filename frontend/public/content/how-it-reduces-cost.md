# How This Reduces Cost

Cost reduction comes from simplification, not reduced coverage.

## Fewer Manual Work Orders
- Automation handles the majority of common access and lifecycle cases
- Central teams focus on exceptions, not volume

**Impact:** Lower operational cost and faster turnaround.

## Less Rework and Remediation
- Improved data quality
- Fewer failed processes
- Reduced audit remediation effort

**Impact:** Lower hidden cost across business and technology teams.

## Consolidated Identity Capabilities
- Reduced duplication across identity and PAM tooling
- Shared capabilities built once and reused
- SaaS adoption where appropriate

**Impact:** Lower licensing cost and simpler operating model.

The result is a lower cost per application, lower cost per access decision, and lower cost to operate identity controls.
