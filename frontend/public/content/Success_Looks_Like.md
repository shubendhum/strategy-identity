# What Success Looks Like

By executing this strategy, the organisation achieves:
- 70–80% reduction in manual identity work
- Faster onboarding of applications and access changes
- Stronger and more consistent security controls
- Improved audit outcomes
- Lower total cost of ownership for identity platforms

Most importantly, identity becomes an enabler of business velocity, not a bottleneck.
